# My-portfolio-
 I have a created a one page portfolio website containing  multiple sections pertaining to my Dev career.The website incorporate the 2 languages taught in our web development class,HTML and CSS.
 The sections include:
 #Overview 
 #Experience
 #Education
 #Skills both technical and soft skills

 It's a simple detail oriented website that sheds light onto me as a developer and a person in tye technology industry.
